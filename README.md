# AI Projects with Python, TensorFlow, and NLTK

This repository contains my notes, code, and personal insights for the LinkedIn Learning course **“AI Projects with Python, TensorFlow and NLTK”**, taught by **Dhhyey Desai** — a Google-Certified Python Expert and Microsoft-Certified Instructor.

## 📚 Course Overview

This course is designed to help you get hands-on experience building practical AI projects in Python using powerful machine learning libraries. It’s beginner-friendly and well-suited for developers looking to build foundational skills in:

- Image classification using **TensorFlow**
- Sentiment analysis using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **NLTK**
- Building recommender systems with **TorchRec** from the PyTorch ecosystem

Throughout the course, you’ll gain exposure to real-world AI workflows, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
